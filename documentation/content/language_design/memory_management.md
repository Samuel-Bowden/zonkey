title: "Memory Management"

As Zonkey aims to be easy for new developers to use, automatic memory management is very important. There are two common ways of implementing automatic memory management, reference counting and garbage collection. Out of the two, reference counting is by far the easiest to implement, but it tends to be a less efficient method compared to garbage collection.

For this project, I have decided to implement automatic memory management with reference counting due to the limited amount of time I have.
