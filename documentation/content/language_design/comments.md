Comments in Zonkey are inspired by Python and are preceded by ‘#’.

```zonkey
...
# Say hi in Japanese
cli:println("やあ");
...
```

Hashtag style comments were chosen as this programming language is targeted towards inexperienced developers. Many of these inexperienced developers will be familiar with the concept on social media where comments prepended with hashtags are used in posts to link them to certain topics. For this reason, I believe that comments in this style will be easier for them to learn.
