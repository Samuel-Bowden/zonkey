# Zonkey Documentation

This site contains the documentation for my final year project, Zonkey.

In this project, I'm going to develop a new programming language called Zonkey and a new browser to run scripts written in the language.

The focus of the Zonkey browser is to allow adults and children inexperienced in software development to very easily develop applications which they can share with people across the world, independent of the platform they are on. People will be able to load these applications into their Zonkey browsers and use them instantly, or choose to install them onto their system and launch them like desktop applications.

The Zonkey language and its libraries are intended to be quickly and easily learnt. Therefore, simplicity and learnability are both key objectives in their design.
