# Zonkey

Zonkey is a new programming language that I'm creating for my final year project. The design will focus on allowing adults and children inexperienced in software development to very easily develop GUI applications which they can share with people across the world. An interpreter and a browser will be created to run Zonkey applications.

## Documentation

Up to date documentation for Zonkey can be viewed at <https://zonkey.sambowden.rocks>.

### Building

To build the documentation, an installation of [hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) is required.

Once this is installed, navigate into the documentation directory.

To preview the documentation on the systems localhost, run:
```
$ hugo serve
```

To build the website, run the following command, which will output the generated code in the public directory:
```
$ hugo
```
